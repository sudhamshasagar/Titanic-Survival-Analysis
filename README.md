# Titanic Survival Analysis
## Overview
  This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster to predict which passengers were likely to survive. Using machine learning techniques, the model evaluates various passenger attributes to determine    survival probabilities.

## Objectives
  Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
  Build a predictive model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.
  Submit predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.
  
## Dataset
  The dataset is provided by Kaggle and contains two files:
    train.csv: Includes features and survival outcomes for training the model.
    test.csv: Includes features without survival outcomes for generating predictions.

## Key Features
  Passenger Information: Name, Age, Gender, Ticket Class, etc.
  Target Variable: Survived (1 for survived, 0 for not survived)
